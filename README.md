MLLinkShortener
===
**MLLinkShortener is a useful class to shorten your links using some of the most common services, like goo.gl, bit.ly or is.gd.**  
It supports blocks and it's asynchronous so your app won't be blocked waiting for the shortened link. It's also ARC-enabled and is compatible with iOS 5.0 SDK and later.  
Here are some features:  
  
* Supports **goo.gl**, **bit.ly**, **is.gd**, **v.gd** and **Linkyy**
* **Block-based**, no more delegates or notifications required.
* **Asynchronous** connections
* Supports for goo.gl and bit.ly API keys
* ARC-enabled
